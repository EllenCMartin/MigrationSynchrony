The role of seasonal migration in spatial population synchrony: Abstract: The extent to which populations of the same species co-fluctuate in abundance (i.e., population synchrony) is key for predicting metapopulation persistence. Nearby populations tend to be the most synchronized because of spatial autocorrelation in the environment. For migratory species, this relationship is more complex, as the environmental stochasticity experienced by a population may change across seasons and locations. Synchrony for migratory species is driven by multiple environmental autocorrelations, including the effect of the environment on the breeding ground and the effect of the environment on the nonbreeding ground. We know that changing environmental autocorrelation will impact spatial population synchrony, but specific patterns in the change in synchrony for different biologically realistic characteristics of migration are unclear. We aim to draw the link between characteristics of migration and spatial population synchrony in biologically relevant scenarios. We simulated the impact of changing environmental autocorrelation on the spatial scaling of synchrony based on population-dynamic modelling across combinations of migration strategies, investigating the questions of where populations go when they migrate and how they get there. Mean spatial population synchrony estimated on the breeding ground was strongly influenced by the strength of environmental autocorrelation experienced off the breeding ground. Importantly, these effects depended on the type and characteristics of migration, such as size and number of nonbreeding grounds. These results have implications for our general understanding of spatial population synchrony and impacts of environmental change.
